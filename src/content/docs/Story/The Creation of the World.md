## The Emergence

Before the world, there was only **[[The Void Sea]]**. It was an infinite density of unshaped potential, turning endlessly in a silence older than time. It was a storm without a sky, a hunger without a mouth. It was a primordial chaotic force, neither cruel nor benevolent, whose motions were boundless and unpredictable, yet pregnant with the seeds of possibility. Within this vastness, patterns had not yet taken shape, but the raw power of existence pulsed in every eddy and swirl.

In its ceaseless motion, the Void reached a threshold where, for the first time, it pressed inward upon itself. Turbulence folded upon turbulence, currents interlacing into forms that had never existed before. From this first impulse toward structure and order arose **[[Lothas, God of Creation]]**, not born, but realised, the Void’s first understanding of shape, of intention, of boundaries. In Lothas, potential found form.

Yet the Void Sea did not collapse into stillness. At the same moment that patterns emerged, other currents surged outward, extending and unfolding in motion, growth, and renewal. From this impulse arose **[[Rethane, Goddess of Nature]]**, not born, but awakened, the Void’s first understanding of life moving through form. Where Lothas gave edges, Rethane gave pulse; where he set limits, she gave flow. Together, they were not opposites, but the first harmony within the chaos: structure and motion, form and change. Each defined the other, and through their unity, the Void became something more than itself.

## The Shaping of the World

Lothas turned his will to the forming of the world, raising mountains with deliberate strength, carving rivers with patient precision, and shaping oceans with endless care. Every valley, every stone, every sweeping plain bore the imprint of his intention. Behind him, Rethane moved like wind through the stillness, weaving life into the contours he had made. She brought forth the first stirrings of life: beasts that prowled and grazed, fish that darted through waters, birds that winged through the sky, and plants that rooted and flourished. Each was a raw expression of her essence, a test of balance, resilience, and fragility within the new world.

As she learned the patterns of life, Rethane planted **[[The World Tree, Elothir]]**, a bridge between the divine and the mortal, a conduit for intention within living matter. Elothir was not the source of life, but a living conduit that canalised the harmony of Lothas and Rethane into the world. Through its roots and drifting dust, the divine intent flowed into the land, preparing the world for beings capable of thought, memory, and purpose. Through the tree, Lothas’ structure and Rethane’s vitality intertwined, giving rise to the first sentient races, whose lives would echo the harmony of their creators.

In time, the land shaped by Lothas’ hand and quickened by Rethane’s breath came to be known as **[[Nythur]]**, the first world to rise from the depths of **[[The Void Sea]]**, a place where the balance of structure and life would endure, and where the first sparks of consciousness would shine.

## The First Races

### Elves

From the first dusts of Elothir, the **[[Elves]]** appeared, shaped by Rethane’s breath as it passed through the branches. They were the first to awaken with full awareness, carrying the clearest echo of the divine spark. Over time, the elves drifted into two peoples:

- **[[The Sundrians, or Sand Elves]]** : born where Elothir’s roots reached into the deserts. The sun tempered their bodies and their magic, making them resilient, sharp-sensed, and tied to shifting dunes and mirages.

- **[[The Lunaris, or High Elves]]** : formed from the upper boughs touched by moonlight. They inherited a calmer, contemplative nature, leaning toward scholarship, arcane studies, and rigid social traditions.

### Humans

As life spread farther from Elothir’s trunk, the **[[Humans]]** emerged. They began as an experiment of Lothas, moulded from soil he had shaped in raising mountains, the so-called “imperfect clay.” Lothas could not complete them, but Rethane, admiring his work, breathed vigour into these forms, granting them life, adaptability, and a land to prosper. Unlike dwarves, whose bodies and spirits were shaped with precise care, humans carry a blend of intention and chance, giving them a restless energy and the capacity to thrive in unpredictable ways.
### Dwarves

Deep beneath the roots, where stone met the oldest echoes of Lothas’ power, the **[[Dwarves]]** took form. They were sculpted by Lothas himself, unfinished statues that Rethane later animated with the heartbeat of the earth. Though Lothas and Rethane always worked in harmony, each acted according to their nature: Lothas shaped, Rethane gave life. Their bodies carry fragments of the mountains, and their culture still revolves around craft, tradition, and memory.
### Beastfolks

In the far deserts, where Rethane’s life-essence mingled with remnants of the Void Sea, the first **[[Beastfolks]]** appeared. They were born from dust of Elothir infused with raw chaos, a mixture of order and wildness. Many clan lineages still claim descent from specific desert beasts: jackals, lions, scaled lizards, and great birds of prey. Their unusual origin, part tree, part Void, often places them at odds with elves, who claim ancestral rights over the desert and pride themselves on their closeness to Rethane.

## The Emergence of the Lesser Gods

As Lothas and Rethane tended their creation, fragments of their divine power coalesced into new beings, the lesser gods. These entities were bound to specific aspects of the world: some to rivers, mountains, and forests; others to fire, storms, or the stars. Unlike their progenitors, they did not shape the world itself, but guided, protected, and sometimes challenged the mortal races.

Some lesser gods became patrons of the elves, humans, dwarves, and beastfolks, teaching early magic, arts, and crafts. Others wandered the wild lands freely, shaping beasts, deserts, and forests according to their will. Their presence was a living echo of the primordial gods, and through them, the mortal world began to feel the first true diversity of divine influence.

## The Early World

For many centuries after the awakening of the races, **[[Nythur]]** flourished under the gentle guidance of Lothas and Rethane, with the quiet influence of the lesser gods growing across the land. Rivers ran clear and full, mountains stood firm, and the sun and moon traced their steady courses.

The mortal races thrived in harmony with the land. **[[Elves]]** tended the forests and deserts, humans cultivated fertile valleys and plains, dwarves mined deep into the mountains, and Beastfolks roamed the wild deserts freely. All sentient life was shaped and guided through **[[The World Tree, Elothir]]**, while animals, plants, and other creatures existed independently, born from Rethane’s early life-essence. Many early civilisations built shrines and sanctuaries at the roots of the tree, seeking to honour the divine spark that flowed through the world.

Even the simplest creatures, birds, fish, and beasts, seemed touched by divinity. Some early monks and clerics claimed to hear whispers of the gods in the rustling leaves, the roaring rivers, and the call of the wind. Magic, though subtle, flowed naturally in the world, a gift of the gods rather than a force to be wielded.

It was a time of balance, when the raw life born from Rethane’s early creations and the shaped life guided by Elothir existed in a single rhythm.
